                    <h3>Greetings, fellow humans and other non-human entities (Web crawlers, I see you.)!</h3>

                    <p>My name is Vivek Khatri. I am a backend engineer who like to work on early stage products. I like
                        the fast feedback loop.</p>
                    <p>I have worked at one mid size b2b saas place, quick commerce startup and an early social consumer
                        app. I like startups. I currently work at one. My aim is to become the go-to backend guy for
                        early stage products. I have used multiple tech stacks - Java + MySql, Node + Mongo, Python +
                        Postgres, Python + Mongo, Sprinkle some golang too.</p>
                    <p>I recently have also started contributing to the Frontend, although I am no master at it, I get
                        things done with help of my colleagues. I love writing code and I am grateful that I do it for a
                        living. I cannot think of anything else that I'd rather be doing.</p>
                    <p>I love to read sci-fi and fantasy books. I draw comics some times, I write fictional stories, I
                        also crack some jokes here and there. </p>
